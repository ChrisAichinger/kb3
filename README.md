# KnowledgeBase3 - a knowledge base / anti-social bookmark service

Originally based on Pete Zaitcev's [Slasti](https://github.com/zaitcev/slasti), but evolved in a pretty different direction over time.

Supports:

* Show similar bookmarks when entering a new one
* Bookmark duplicate detection
* Supports geo-tagging entries and map-visualization
* Auto-completion of tags
* Mathjax math rendering
* Cross-links between entries (in [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) style)
* Star-rating of entries
* Reasonably advanced search and filter capabilities
